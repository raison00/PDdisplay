# Product Display Presentation
CSS Product Display - no javascript, just css.
This uses webfonts and basic css animation and transitions to provide smooth motion and information ontop of the product images for PDP (product display pages) and other pages requiring/featuring products.

PDP pages and products displayed on Content pages have a large imprint on the page - this helps show an alternative approach for product information on content pages.

note, this is fluid (scales/changes based on window size) - try it!
