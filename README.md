# Product Display Prototype Presentation

CSS Product Display - no javascript, just css.

This prototype uses webfonts and basic css animation and transitions to provide smooth motion and information ontop of the product images for PDP (product display pages) and other pages requiring/featuring products.

PDP pages and products displayed on Marketing Content Pages have a large imprint on the page - this helps show an alternative approach for product information on Marketing pages.

## Product Display Page Integration
- Can work on any internal framework from legacy to all newly siloed stacks without impacting performance
- Does not require any additional libraries 
- Will not conflict with other code contributions to the page
- Can utilize API to add shopping directly from the image

## The code in action:

This is fluid (scales/changes based on window size) - try it!
